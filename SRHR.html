                            Mental health among youth is a growing concern. Many face stressors like academic pressure, social media, and peer expectations, leading to anxiety, depression, and other mental health challenges. Stigma often discourages seeking help, exacerbating these issues. It's crucial to prioritize mental health awareness, provide accessible resources, and encourage open conversations. Early intervention and support can prevent long-term consequences and empower young individuals to lead emotionally healthy lives. By acknowledging and addressing the mental health needs of youth, we can foster resilience, emotional well-being, and brighter futures for the next generation. We provide a safe space for the youth to talk freely without bias and occasionally have nature walks to help connect mental health to nature.
