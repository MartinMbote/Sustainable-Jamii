                        Economic governance is a multifaceted thematic area that revolves around the pursuit of fairness, equity, and
                        equality within economic systems. It addresses the imbalances, disparities, and structural inequalities
                        that can emerge due to various factors such as income gaps, wealth concentration, discrimination, and
                        unequal access to resources and opportunities. At its core, economic justice seeks to create a socioeconomic landscape where everyone has the chance to thrive and lead a life of dignity, regardless of
                        their background or circumstances.

                        <br> <br>

                        Sustainable Jamii has one of the central objectives of economic justice which is to rectify income
                        inequality. Income inequality is a pressing concern in many societies, where a small segment of the
                        population holds a disproportionately large share of the income, leaving others with limited economic
                        prospects. We advocate for policies and measures that promote a more equitable distribution of income. This might involve progressive taxation systems, minimum wage laws, and social safety nets to
                        provide a safety cushion for those facing economic hardships.

                        <br> <br>

                        Access to basic necessities is a fundamental aspect of economic justice. In an equitable society, we
                        believe that every individual should have access to essentials like healthcare, education, housing, clean
                        water, and adequate nutrition. Economic justice endeavors to eliminate disparities in access to these
                        basic needs, particularly for marginalized communities. This can involve advocating for universal
                        healthcare systems, affordable housing initiatives, and programs that ensure access to quality education
                        regardless of socioeconomic status.

                    Sustainable Jamii has equipped access to justice as a fundamental pillar of economic justice, as it
                    empowers individuals to navigate and challenge economic systems that may disadvantage them

                    <br> <br>

                    Access to justice within the context of economic justice is a critical aspect that ensures individuals and
                    communities have the means to address economic inequalities, seek remedies for injustices, and uphold
                    their rights within economic systems. It encompasses the right to a fair and impartial legal process, the
                    ability to challenge economic disparities, and the opportunity to hold institutions and individuals
                    accountable for actions that perpetuate economic injustices.

                    <br> <br>

                    Access to justice also facilitates the participation of marginalized and vulnerable populations in
                    economic decision-making processes. When individuals have the means to voice their concerns and
                    challenge unjust economic policies, they contribute to shaping a more inclusive and responsive
                    economic system. This empowerment of marginalized voices helps address systemic biases and ensures
                    that economic policies consider a broader spectrum of perspectives.

                    <br> <br>

                    Sustainable Jamii empowers individuals to challenge economic inequalities, demand accountability, and
                    participate in economic decision-making processes. By providing avenues to address economic
                    disparities, hold economic actors accountable, and promote inclusivity, access to justice contributes to
                    building more equitable and just economic systems.

                    Financial literacy among today's youth is a pressing concern. Many young individuals lack essential
                    knowledge about managing money, budgeting, and making informed financial decisions. This deficit can
                    lead to debt, poor credit, and limited economic opportunities. To address this, comprehensive financial
                    education programs should be integrated into school curricula and community initiatives. Empowering
                    youth with practical skills like saving, investing, and understanding credit can help them navigate the
                    complexities of the modern financial world. By promoting financial literacy, we equip young people with
                    the tools they need to make responsible financial choices, achieve financial stability, and build a secure
                    future.

                    We advocate for laws, regulations, and markets to work in favor of marginalized groups. We support
                    our partners in their advocacy and campaigning efforts and also directly mobilize citizens, policymakers,
                    and other relevant actors in the Eastern, Central, and southern African regions to ratify the African
                    Youth Charter (AYC) that was endorsed on 2 July 2006 by the African Union Heads of States and
                    Governments meeting in Banjul (Gambia). It entered into force on 8 August 2009. The Charter is a
                    political and legal document that serves as the strategic framework for African States, giving direction
                    for youth empowerment and development at continental, regional, and national levels. It originated
                    from the need to address the situation of the Youth in Africa, many of whom have been marginalized by
                    society through wealth and power inequalities, poor quality of education, limited health care,
                    unemployment, and exposure to violence. It defines youth or young people as every person between
                    the ages of 15 and 35 years. To take effect, African Member States need to ratify the Charter and
                    translate the Charter&apos;s commitments into their national laws. It is an active document. Ratifications, 42
                    Member States have signed Charter, 38 Member States have ratified Charter and 3 Member States are
                    yet to sign and ratify.

                    people with disabilities how they monitor actions of the executive. The ACDEG Charter commits

                    democratic culture and practices that are accountable to the public. Parliaments and local governments
