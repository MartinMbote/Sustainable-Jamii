                        The concept of climate justice acknowledges that those who contribute the least to greenhouse gas emissions often bear the greatest burden of the consequences, such as extreme weather events, food and water scarcity, displacement, and health issues. It emphasizes the importance of ensuring fair distribution of resources, promoting human rights, and addressing systemic inequalities in the context of climate change.

It calls for the recognition of climate-related losses and damages, seeking accountability from those who are primarily responsible for causing climate change and supporting affected communities in coping with its impacts.
